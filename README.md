### Aside
I've just now realized the "Profesional" is not the correct spelling for "Professional". I realize the irony in this and accept the consequences of this. I've gotten in the habit of having a word processor open while I work to avoid misspellings like this. Being this deep into the project I feel as though I don't have the skills or time to remedy an issue like this which will definitely affect pathing for the repo. Thank you for your understanding.
